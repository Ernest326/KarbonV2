# KarbonEngine V2
## KarbonEngine is a simple game engine which includes an editor and a core engine  
This is a reboot of one of my older projects I had dropped, as I dived into Vulkan with no prior knowledge and experience and so I feel like I want to make a fully functional game engine in OpenGL and build up from there  
The goal is to be able to compile a working executable and include physics, asset managment, user scripting and to be able to efficiently handle optimisations and memory
